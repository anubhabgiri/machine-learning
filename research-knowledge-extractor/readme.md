# Research Knowledge Extractor

This is a research knowledge extractor that can extract knowledge from research papers. At this point it is a mini project. Hopefully in future it will evolve into something more. 

## Objective

extract useful information from research papers through answering a questions and building a report relevant to the publications of the entire category.

## Approach and Methods

I have split the overall task into 3 sub tasks 
- Understanding the question
- Extracting relevant information from the paper
- Synthesizing the information into an appropriate answer

I am using an agentic system with each agent having single responsibility. 

## System requirements 

I have used Python `3.12.10` for this project but any Python version 3.8+ should be fine. 

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
